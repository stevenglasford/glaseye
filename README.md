# glaseye 

glaseye is a project of glasford.io with the eventual goal of reducing crime through means of pacism. glaseye can also be seen as a surveilence tool. The main use of glaseye is to use AI and computer vision to "incidents". But it also contains many other useful items.

## Part 1
Part 1 of glaseye is facial detection of unique visitors. This part is actually sort of funny as it was basically 100% created by an AI, and it seems to work. Which I found to actually be very interesting. 
I debated whether I should post this as it seems like cheating, but I think the world should actually be able to use this. 

Background: I have a building that I need to generate a list of unique visitors and save a picture of the unique visitor's face along with a timestamp in UTC time with the person's first face.
